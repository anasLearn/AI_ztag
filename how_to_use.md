# How to use the simulation
The user can set the pre-conditions of the simulation in the file `data.py`

To launch the program, execute the file "execute.bat" if you are running on windows, or run the command python3 main.py if you are using another OS.

The interface allows you to choose the preliminary conditions for the simulation. And then you can:
- Visualize a game.
- Run the simulation for a specific number of times.
- Run all possible simulations for a specific number of times.
